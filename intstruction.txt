You are a senior UI/UX designer building the **Airline Booking System** web app (MVP v1.0).  
Use a **modern, clean, responsive** design language with **Tailwind-CSS-style utility classes** (no custom CSS needed).  
Color palette: Primary #0D6EFD (blue), Success #198754, Warning #FFC107, Danger #DC3545, Neutral #6C757D, Background #F8F9FA.  
Typography: Inter (Google Font) – H1 2rem bold, H2 1.5rem bold, Body 1rem regular, Small 0.875rem.  
Spacing: 8px grid, 1rem = 16px.  
All screens must be **mobile-first** (375px breakpoint) and show a **desktop preview** (1440px) in the same frame.  
Include **form validation states** (success/error) and **loading skeletons** where applicable.  
Add **micro-interactions** hints (e.g., hover lift, focus ring).  

---  
**GLOBAL LAYOUT** (apply to every screen):  
• Sticky top navbar (logo left, search icon, profile avatar right)  
• Footer with copyright & links  
• Container max-width 1280px, centered  

---  
Generate **exactly 5 screens per phase** below.  
Name frames exactly as listed.  
After each phase, I will say “NEXT PHASE” to continue.
